## Introduction

Cybersecurity vulnerabilities in software pose significant risks to organizations and end-users. Traditional methods of categorization and identification of such vulnerabilities can be time-consuming and error-prone. This research project aims to develop a more efficient and accurate approach by leveraging Machine Learning techniques to categorize cybersecurity vulnerabilities in software automatically.

## Research Paper

The comprehensive details of our research, including methodologies, experimental setup, results, and discussions, have been documented in our research paper.
